SSHClient:

 - Permit to have an alternate key per host, like is is for username
 - Better way to use the multiple processes, so the next chunks may start before all the previous chunk has finished (use select() ?…).

 
Host selection: Use the same tag system than in the Paw project ?

Arguments handling: use the argparse module ? The current arguments handling is quite basic, it can’t handle option repetition for instance.
