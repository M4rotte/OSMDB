Port the fix of Cmdline.py to project Paw & PCM (and maybe some other projects) (IndexError on empty option value…)

SSHClient:
 - save/restore key
 - implement a mass-ssh-copy-id command to quickly “deploy” OSMDB: Use the same than in the Paw project
 
Host selection: Use the same tag system than in the Paw project
