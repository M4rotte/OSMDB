SSHClient:

 - Permit to have an alternate key per host, like is is for username
 - Better way to use the multiple processes, so the next chunks may start before all the previous chunk has finished (use select() ?…).
 
Tag system: tag negation (with !)

Arguments handling: use the argparse module ? The current arguments handling is quite basic, it can’t handle option repetition for instance (but it’s not needed for now).

Catch error when chunk size is too high so the program raises "max open files" on updating → give up without a crash.
