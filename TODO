SSHClient:

 - Permit to have an alternate key per host, like is is for username
 - Better way to use the multiple processes, so the next chunks may start before all the previous chunk has finished (use select() ?…).
 - Dpwnload the whole SSL chain ad permit an optional conformity check for URL which provide such a verified SSL infrastructure

Tag system: tag negation (with !)

Arguments handling: use the argparse module ? The current arguments handling is quite basic, it can’t handle option repetition for instance (but it’s not needed for now).

Catch the following error (on snmp update) :

Looks like it suffixes the domain but in my case the hostname is already a FQDN (and the other field, "hostname", could also contain a plain FQDN)
